## ‚ú® Features

### üìä Monitoring
- Agents installed on each node (server). (Agent repo: https://github.com/sanda0/vps_pilot_agent)
- Agents send system metrics to the central server:
  - **CPU usage**
  - **Memory usage**
  - **Network statistics**
- Metrics are visualized in the dashboard with selectable time ranges:
  - 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 2 days, 7 days.
---

### üö® Alerting
- Users can configure alerts based on metric thresholds.
- Notifications sent via:
  - **Discord** (‚úÖ Implemented)
  - **Email** (‚úÖ Implemented)
  - **Slack** (‚úÖ Implemented)

### üöÄ Projects Management (TODO)
- Each node can have multiple projects.
- Projects require a `config.vpspilot.json` file.
- Agents scan disks for project config files and send project metadata to the central server.
- Central server will display available projects and allow:
  - Running predefined commands.
  - Managing project logs.
  - Backing up project directories and databases.

**Sample `config.vpspilot.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "meta ads dashboard",
  "tech": ["laravel", "react", "mysql"],
  "logs": [],
  "commands": [
    { "name": "node build", "command": "npm run build" },
    { "name": "php build", "command": "composer install" }
  ],
  "backups": {
    "env_file": ".env",
    "zip_file_name": "project_backup",
    "database": {
      "connection": "DB_CONNECTION",
      "host": "DB_HOST",
      "port": "DB_PORT",
      "username": "DB_USERNAME",
      "password": "DB_PASSWORD",
      "database_name": "DB_DATABASE"
    },
    "dir": [
